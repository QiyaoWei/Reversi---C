# Reversi---C
A game of Reversi (also named Othello) and a Reversi AI programmed in C

Step 1: Download the .c file and create a project in any IDE (such as Netbeans)

Step 2: Run the program. You will be playing against a relatively smart computer.

Note: Graphics has not been implemented. User input will be through the command prompt, and the program prints the Reversi board as by printing the numbers on each square, similar to printing a matrix of numbers
